## 1. Clone Minimal Mistakes
- [Original repository](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).
- Instructions are [here](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).
   - I installed used the _Remote theme method_.

## 2. Develop locally
- To develop locally, use `jekyll serve`.
- I needed to add `gem 'jekyll-include-cache'` to my Gemfile to get this to work.
