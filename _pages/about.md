# About Me

I received my Ph.D. from the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the [University of Maryland](https://ece.umd.edu/) in 2020. I was funded by a fellowship by the [Brain and Behavior Initiative](http://bbi.umd.edu/). My dissertation involved characterizing dynamics and connectivity in neuroimaging data using deep learning. 

I grew up in Bangalore, India, and have a bachelor's degree from the [National Institute of Technology, Karnataka](https://www.nitk.ac.in/).
